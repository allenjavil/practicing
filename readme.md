Hello! This is the first of my self-review projects. It's been some time since I coded in python as I haven't taken CS courses these last two semesters (and my engineering curriculum has kept me quite busy 😅). 

For this repository, I followed along the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I, which I found extremely informational while also promoting logic when coding! 

Throughout the code I wrote some notes that explained my understanding of this tutorial, which also helped with my own information recalling. 

I'll be working on more review projects/tutorials. However, I'm hoping to move onto planning my own unique project.
